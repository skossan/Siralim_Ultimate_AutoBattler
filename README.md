# Siralim Ultimate AutoBattler
This script will press E for you. Even when the game window is not in focus.

## How to use the script
- You can **toggle** the script on/off with **CTRL + SHIFT + E**
- You can **reload** the script with **CTRL + SHIFT + R**
- You can **exit** the script with **CTRL + SHIFT + Q**

## How does the script work?
The script will look for a process running on the PC called *SiralimUltimate.exe*.

If the process is found and you enable the script it will automatically send keystrokes for the letter *E* over and over to that process. This *simulates* holding E and enables you to do other things while the game presses E for you.

If the script can't find the process you will see an error message stating that the game isn't running.

## Why does the script get stuck during combat?
This is how the game is designed and the script is not at fault. To get the most out of this script you want to use **macros**. Set up your conditions using the macro editor then set *macro* as your default option.
If your macros gets stuck then manual input is required.
