# Siralim_Ultimate_AutoBattler
This is a simple script that will auto battle for you even when the game window is not in focus.

## How to use the script
- You can **toggle** the script on/off with **CTRL + SHIFT + E**
- You can **reload** the script with **CTRL + SHIFT + R**
- You can **exit** the script with **CTRL + SHIFT + Q**

This is what the script looks like

## How does the script work?
The script will look for a process running on the PC called *SiralimUltimate.exe*.

If the process is found and you enable the script it will automatically send keystrokes for the letter *E* over and over to that process. This *simulates* holding E and enables to you do other things while the game presses E for you.

If the script can't find the process you will see an error message stating that the game isn't running.0
